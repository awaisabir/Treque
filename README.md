#Treque Data Structure

This was part of an exercise where we were expected to create a new Data Structure called a Treque. This was implemented together with Yaoshen Jiang (https://www.github.com/jasonjys).
This data structure adds elements at a constant complexity in the head, tail & middle, together with proper balancing when the elements of one Deque are > 2 than the other!
